  "recommendation": "The code snippet has multiple security concerns, including a potentially sensitive API key and the use of the eval function, which can pose a significant security risk. It is advisable to refactor the code to remove the hardcoded API key, replace the eval function with a safer alternative, and address the unresolved TODO comment.",
  "risk_score": 90,

const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY || '';
