# Reporting & Compliance

Tharos provides flexible reporting options to suit different workflows, from local debugging to enterprise compliance auditing.

## 📊 HTML Audit Reports

For a visual overview of your project's security posture, generating an HTML report is the best option. This self-contained file is perfect for sharing with stakeholders or archiving as an audit artifact.

```bash
tharos analyze . --format html > audit-report.html
```

The HTML report features:
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Filter and sort findings by severity.
- **Glassmorphic UI**: A premium, modern design.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Everything is embedded in a single file—no external CSS or JS required.

## 🏗️ SARIF Integration

Standardized integration with CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) is achieved via the SARIF format.

```bash
tharos analyze . --format sarif > results.sarif
```

Upload this file to GitHub Advanced Security to see Tharos findings directly in your pull request annotations.

## 💻 CLI Output Formats

You can also output raw JSON for custom tooling or piping into `jq`.

```bash
# JSON Output
tharos analyze . --format json

# Standard Rich Output (Default)
tharos analyze .
```
