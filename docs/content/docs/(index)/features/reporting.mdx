# Reporting & Compliance

Tharos provides flexible reporting options to suit different workflows, from local debugging to enterprise compliance auditing.

## 🦊 Local Security Dashboard

For the most interactive experience, Tharos provides a built-in local dashboard. This is a high-fidelity web interface that runs right from your terminal, allowing you to browse findings, visualize risk scores, and manage security patches in your browser.

```bash
# Launch the dashboard locally
tharos ui
```

The Local Dashboard includes:
- **Interactive File Explorer**: Navigate through your project and see security health at a glance.
- **Vulnerability Breakdown**: Detailed explanations and remediation steps for every finding.
- **AI Integration**: One-click "Magic Fixes" and semantic risk assessment.
- **Modern Dark UI**: A premium, glassmorphic design optimized for security engineers.

## 🏗️ Enterprise SARIF Integration

Standardized integration with CI/CD platforms like **GitHub Advanced Security** is achieved via the refined SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) exporter.

```bash
# Generate a professional SARIF report for CI/CD
tharos analyze . --format sarif > results.sarif
```

Our SARIF output is fully compliant with industry standards and includes:
- **Detailed Metadata**: Comprehensive descriptions, help URIs, and tags for every security rule.
- **Stable Indexing**: Persistent rule IDs for consistent reporting across builds.
- **Precise Location Mapping**: Exact line and column identifiers for surgical auditing.

## 💻 CLI Output Formats

You can also output raw JSON for custom tooling or piping into `jq`.

```bash
# JSON Output
tharos analyze . --format json

# Standard Rich Output (Default)
tharos analyze .
```
