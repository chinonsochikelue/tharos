# AI Magic Fix ✨

Tharos v1.3.0 introduces a revolutionary **AI Magic Fix** engine. It doesn't just find security issues; it fixes them. Using advanced AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash), Tharos generates context-aware patches that resolve vulnerabilities while maintaining your project's coding style with 100% verified accuracy.

## 🎮 Interactive Fix Mode

The best way to remediate findings is through the dedicated `fix` command. This launches a premium interactive TUI where you can audit each proposed change before it touches your code.

```bash
tharos fix .
```

### Premium Features

Tharos v1.3.0 brings an enterprise-grade interactive experience:

- **⠋ Animated Spinner**: Real-time feedback while the AI analyzes and generates your fix.
- **📊 Confidence Meter**: Visual color-coded bars (Green/Yellow/Red) showing how reliable the AI considers the fix.
  - 🟢 **High (90%+)**: Safe to apply immediately.
  - 🟡 **Medium (70-89%)**: Review recommended.
  - 🔴 **Low (`<70%`)**: Manual intervention suggested.
- **📝 Enhanced Diffs**: Beautiful, bold before/after previews highlighting exactly what will change.

### Navigation & Actions

The interactive session is intuitive:

- **Arrow Keys/Select**: Use the interactive menu to choose your action.
- **Apply Fix**: Apply the suggested patch immediately with automatic backup.
- **Explain Risk**: Get a detailed AI explanation of the vulnerability and the remediation strategy.
- **Skip**: Ignore this finding for now.
- **Quit**: Safely end the session.

## ⚡ Auto-Fix Mode

For large projects, you can batch-apply fixes. Tharos will only apply fixes that meet your specified confidence threshold.

```bash
# Apply fixes with 95% confidence or higher
tharos fix . --auto --confidence 0.95
```

## 🛡️ Safety: Backup & Rollback

Every time you apply a fix, Tharos automatically creates a timestamped backup of the original file. If anything goes wrong, you can revert instantly.

```bash
# Rollback to a specific backup
tharos fix --rollback 20260208_223549
```

Backups are stored in the `.tharos-backup` directory in your project root.

## How It Works

1. **Context Extraction**: Tharos extracts the vulnerable code snippet along with 10-token sliding window context.
2. **AI Analysis**: Gemini 2.5 Flash analyzes the vulnerability and generates a safe replacement.
3. **Safety Validation**: Tharos ensures the original content matches before applying any changes.
4. **Backup Generation**: A secure copy of your file is saved before modification.
5. **Atomic Application**: Fixes are applied line-by-line with precision.
