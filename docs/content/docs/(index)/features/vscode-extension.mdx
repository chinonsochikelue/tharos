# VS Code Extension

The Tharos VS Code extension brings enterprise-grade security analysis directly into your development workflow.

## Features

### 📦 Zero-Config Experience
Tharos comes bundled with pre-compiled binaries for **Windows, macOS, and Linux**. Unlike other security extensions, you don't need to install any external compilers or runtimes. It works out of the box.

### ✨ Magic Fixes (Quick Fixes)
When Tharos detects a vulnerability, look for the **lightbulb icon (💡)**.
1. Hover over the red/yellow squiggly line.
2. Click the lightbulb.
3. Select **"✨ Tharos: Apply Magic Fix"**.
4. The AI-generated secure patch is applied instantly.

### 🎯 Precise Highlighting
Tharos uses AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) analysis to point you to the exact line and token that triggered a policy violation. This reduces manual triaging time by showing you exactly what went wrong.

### 🔄 Real-time Feedback
- **Scan-on-Open**: Security checks run as soon as you open a file.
- **Scan-on-Save**: Every save triggers a fresh audit to ensure no new regressions were introduced.

## Configuration

You can customize the extension behavior in your user settings:

- `tharos.strictMode`: (Boolean) Enable to treat all findings as blocking errors.
- `tharos.binaryPath`: (String) Optional override to use a specific `tharos` binary.

## Support
The extension supports scanning for:
- **TypeScript / JavaScript**
- **Go**
- **Python**
