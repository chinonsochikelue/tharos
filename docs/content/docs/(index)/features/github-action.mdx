# GitHub Action

The official Tharos GitHub Action allows you to automatically scan your repository for security vulnerabilities and hardcoded secrets on every push or pull request. It integrates directly with GitHub's **Security** tab using the SARIF format.

## Quick Start

Add the following step to your `.github/workflows/security.yml` file:

```yaml
- name: Tharos Security Scan
  uses: collabchron/tharos/tharos-action@v1
  with:
    path: '.'        # Analyze root directory
    ai: true         # Enable AI semantic insights
    sarif: 'results.sarif'
```

## Features

### 🛡️ One-Line Integration
No manual installation or configuration of Go/binaries required. The action automatically sets up the environment and runs the analysis.

### 📊 Security Tab Integration
Findings are uploaded directly to the GitHub Security dashboard. You'll see precise annotations in your code view and a detailed breakdown in the security overview.

### 🤖 AI Semantic Insights
Enable `ai: true` to get deep risk scoring and suggested fixes directly in your PR comments.

## Configuration Options

| Input | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `path` | The directory or file to scan. | `.` |
| `ai` | Enable AI-powered semantic analysis. | `false` |
| `policy` | Path to a custom `tharos.yaml` policy file. | (none) |
| `sarif` | Filename for saving the SARIF report. | `results.sarif' |
