# AI Writing Assistant

Notiq integrates seamlessly with advanced LLMs (like GPT-4) to help you write faster, better, and more creatively.

## Features

### Smart Writing
Select any text and use the AI menu to:
- **Improve Writing**: Enhances clarity and flow.
- **Fix Grammar**: Polishes your text for professional quality.
- **Change Tone**: Switch between formal, casual, or persuasive.
- **Shorten/Lengthen**: Quickly adjust content length.

### Contextual AI Chat
Ask questions about your document directly. The AI understands the context of your current writing, allowing you to:
- Summarize long sections.
- Brainstorm new ideas based on existing content.
- Translate text to different languages.

### Intelligent Auto-completion
Notiq provides smart suggestions as you type, helping you complete sentences and stay in the flow.

## Configuration

To enable AI features, you need to provide an API endpoint in your `Editor` configuration:

```tsx
<Editor 
  aiConfig={{
    apiEndpoint: "/api/ai",
  }}
/>
```

The endpoint should handle requests for completion and chat, typically using the `ai` SDK.
