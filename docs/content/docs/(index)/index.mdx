## Core Capabilities

### 🛡️ Server-Side Security (New!)
Tharos now includes specialized detection for modern Node.js and Express.js applications:
- **SQL Injection**: Detects direct variable interpolation in SQL template literals.
- **Credential Scanning**: Identifies hardcoded passwords and keys in database connection objects.
- **Sensitive Route Detection**: Flags unprotected patterns like `/admin`, `/debug`, or `/config`.
- **Environment Leakage**: Warns against direct exposure of `process.env`.

### ⚡ Hybrid Analysis Engine
- **Go-Core**: Our analysis engine is written in Go for maximum performance and portability.
- **Polyglot Support**: Native support for JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and more.
- **Git Integration**: Self-healing pre-commit hooks that prevent insecure code from being committed.

### 🧠 AI remediation
- **Semantic Understanding**: Finds vulnerabilities that traditional linters miss by understanding code flow.
- **Risk Scoring**: Every finding is assigned an AI-calculated risk score (0-100) to help you prioritize.
- **Actionable Fixes**: Don't just find bugs—fix them with AI-generated diffs.
