## Managing Sponsors

Sponsors are managed in `docs/src/lib/sponsors.ts`. To add a new sponsor:

```typescript
export const sponsors: Sponsor[] = [
  {
    id: 'your-company',
    name: 'Your Company',
    description: 'Brief description of your company',
    logo: '/sponsors/your-logo.png',
    url: 'https://yourcompany.com',
    tier: 'gold',
    type: 'sponsor'
  }
]
```

For inline ads in content, use the `InlineAd` component:

```mdx
import { InlineAd } from '@/components/sponsors'

<InlineAd sponsor={{
  id: 'example',
  name: 'Example Product',
  description: 'Your product description',
  logo: '/ads/example.png',
  url: 'https://example.com',
  tier: 'gold',
  type: 'ad'
}} />
```
