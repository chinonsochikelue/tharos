# Quickstart

Get started with Tharos as your intelligent git hook scanner in minutes.

## Installation

Install the Tharos CLI globally using NPM:

```package-install
 -g @collabchron/tharos
```

## Setup

### 1. Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your project root and initialize Tharos:

```bash
tharos init
```

This will:
- Create a `tharos.yaml` configuration file.
- Set up **intelligent git hooks** in `.git/hooks/` to intercept insecure commits.


### 2. Configure AI (Recommended)

Tharos provides deeper insights when connected to an AI provider. Set your API key in your environment variables:

```bash
# For Google Gemini
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key"

# OR For Groq (Fast & Free)
export GROQ_API_KEY="your_key"
```

### 3. Verify Staged Changes

Before committing, you can manually verify that your staged files meet security standards:

```bash
# Check all staged files (this is what the hook runs)
tharos check

# Or analyze a specific file
tharos analyze src/api/login.ts
```


## Continuous Analysis

### Git Hooks
Tharos automatically checks your code during the `pre-commit` stage. If a high-risk vulnerability is detected (like a hardcoded secret), it will block the commit until fixed.

### Magic Fixes
When Tharos finds an issue, use the `fix` command to automatically remediate it:

```bash
tharos fix src/vulnerable-file.js
```
