# Quickstart

Get started with Tharos as your intelligent git hook scanner in minutes.

## Installation

Install the Tharos CLI globally using NPM:

```package-install
 -g @collabchron/tharos
```

## Setup

### 1. Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your project root and initialize Tharos:

```bash
tharos init
```

This will:
- Create a `tharos.yaml` configuration file.
- Set up **intelligent git hooks** in `.git/hooks/` to intercept insecure commits.


### 2. Configure AI (Recommended)

Tharos provides deeper insights when connected to an AI provider. Set your API key in your environment variables:

```bash
# For Google Gemini
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key"

# OR For Groq (Fast & Free)
export GROQ_API_KEY="your_key"
```

### 3. Verify & Fix Findings

Tharos can analyze specific files or your entire project. If issues are found, use the revolutionary **AI Magic Fix** to remediate them instantly:

```bash
# Analyze a specific file
tharos analyze src/api/login.ts

# Launch the interactive AI Magic Fix session
tharos fix .
```

The `fix` command provides a premium TUI with confidence meters and animated spinners to guide you through remediation.


### 4. Interactive Dashboard

Launch the high-fidelity local dashboard to visualize findings and risk scores:

```bash
tharos ui
```

## Continuous Analysis

### Git Hooks
Tharos automatically checks your code during the `pre-commit` stage. If a high-risk vulnerability is detected (like a hardcoded secret), it will block the commit until fixed.

### GitHub Action
Integrate Tharos into your CI/CD pipeline with one line in your workflow:

```yaml
- uses: collabchron/tharos/tharos-action@v1
  with:
    ai: true
```
