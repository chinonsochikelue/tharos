    ### The VS Code & Launch Update

    * **VS Code Extension (v1.0.2)**: Launched the official extension with **Magic Fixes**, zero-config bundled binaries, and precise diagnostic highlighting.
    * **Interactive Remediation**: Extended Magic Fixes to the IDE, allowing one-click security patches alongside the existing CLI interactive mode.
    * **Enterprise Enforcement**: Hardened the exit code logic for CI/CD pipelines, supporting `--strict` mode to fail builds on any security finding.
    * **Multi-Platform Distribution**: Packaged Tharos as a `.vsix` for VS Code and introduced high-fidelity marketing assets for the global launch.
    * **Community & Sponsorship**: Integrated GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective, and Buy Me a Coffee to support the project's long-term growth.

    ### The Intelligent Gatekeeper Update

    * **Polyglot AST Support**: Expanded semantic analysis to include native **Go** (via `go/ast`) and **Python**, detecting complex SQL injection and command injection patterns.
    * **Policy-as-Code Loader**: Introduced dynamic policy injection from YAML files in the `policies/` directory or via the new `--policy` flag.
    * **Premium CLI Dashboard**: Introduced a high-fidelity terminal UI with structured findings tables and a definitive **COMMIT VERDICT** (Pass/Block) banner.
    * **Data-Driven Security Rules**: You can now define custom regex-based security patterns directly in `tharos.yaml` to catch project-specific vulnerabilities.
    * **Smart Risk Scoring**: Integrated `min_risk_score` configuration to filter AI-generated insights, ensuring you only see the most actionable security intelligence.
    * **Self-Healing Git Hooks**: Launched `tharos sync` and background audit systems that automatically detect and heal tampered or missing git hooks.
