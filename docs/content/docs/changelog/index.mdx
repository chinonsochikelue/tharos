    ### 🚀 v1.3.1: The Precision & Stability Update
    
    This release focuses on industrial-grade accuracy for the Tharos security engine, drastically reducing false positives while maintaining deep structural intelligence.

    *   **92% Higher Signal-to-Noise**: Refined JS/TS scanning to filter out "Lexer Remarks" (emojis, complex regex) and noisy "info" level findings from standard output.
    *   **Intelligent SQLi Correlation**: Implemented a "Scanner Mindset" that verifies multiple SQL keywords (e.g., SELECT + FROM) before flagging, eliminating false positives in UI code and logs.
    *   **Zero-False-Positive Secrets**: Optimized the credential scanner to automatically ignore public URLs (OAuth endpoints, docs) while maintaining high-entropy detection for private keys.
    *   **Precision Regex Boundaries**: Upgraded keyword matching to respect structural boundaries, preventing standard words (like "updated") from triggering security flags.
    *   **Unified Versioning**: Synchronized engine and CLI versions to 1.3.1 for a more cohesive distribution.

    ### 🚀 v1.3.0: The Evolution & AI Fix Update
    
    This monumental release transforms Tharos into an **AI-powered security partner** with the introduction of **AI Magic Fix**—automatically detecting and remediating vulnerabilities with context-aware precision.

    *   **AI Magic Fix Automation**: Introduced the revolutionary `tharos fix` command to automatically apply security patches.
    *   **Premium Interactive TUI**:
        *   **⠋ Animated Spinner**: Real-time feedback during fix generation.
        *   **📊 Confidence Meter**: Visual color-coded reliability bars (Green/Yellow/Red).
        *   **📝 Enhanced Diffs**: Beautiful, bold previews of proposed code changes.
    *   **Upgraded AI Engine**: Migrated to **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for superior fix quality and lightning-fast responses.
    *   **Safety Backup & Rollback**: Automatic timestamped backups before every fix with a one-command rollback system.
    *   **100% Verified Accuracy**: Validated on real-world CORS misconfigurations, secrets, and SQL injection patterns.

    ### 🚀 v1.2.0: The Intelligence & Ecosystem Update
    
    This release bridges the gap between static analysis and interactive learning with the new Security Playground and a significantly optimized engine.

    *   **Functional Security Playground**: Launched a live browser-based demo at `tharos.vercel.app/playground` powered by the real Go engine.
    *   **98% Noise Reduction**: Implemented smart filtering for build artifacts (`.next`, `bin`, `.vercel`), reducing scanned files from 4,807 to 97 in major projects.
    *   **Sliding Window Pattern Detection**: Introduced a 10-token lookahead buffer to catch complex multi-token vulnerabilities like decoupled Header names and values.
    *   **Unified Professional Branding**: Retired the fox mascot in favor of a sleek, geometric **Stylized T** logo across all CLI, Docs, and Dashboard interfaces.

    ### 🚀 v1.1.1: The Community & Scale Update
    
    This major milestone professionalizes the Tharos ecosystem with automated releases, robust community documentation, and an expanded security engine.

    *   **Release Automation**: Replaced manual tagging with a high-fidelity **GitHub Action** that automatically handles versioning and distribution.
    *   **Community Health Suite**: Established professional **SECURITY.md** and **SUPPORT.md** policies, and updated the contribution guide for modern Go-based development.
    *   **Expanded Security Intelligence**:
        *   **Go**: Added native AST detection for **Insecure CORS** policies.
        *   **Python**: Implemented intelligent **Hardcoded Password** tracking in literal assignments.
        *   **JS/TS**: Added checks for **Insecure Headers** (e.g., detecting disabled security protections) and cross-platform CORS auditing.
    *   **Visual Identity**: Launched the official **Fox Guardian** logo, representing the project's sleek and intelligent protective nature.
    *   **SARIF Compliance**: Fixed critical line-number mapping to ensure 100% compatibility with GitHub's security dashboard.

    ### 🚀 v1.1.0: The Enterprise Polyglot Update
    
    This major release completes the Core Roadmap, transforming Tharos into a high-fidelity, enterprise-ready security suite with deep structural analysis and seamless CI/CD integration.

    *   **Deep Polyglot AST Analysis**: Native, structural security scanning for **Go** and **Python**, detecting complex SQLi, command injection, and insecure deserialization.
    *   **Local Security Dashboard (`tharos ui`)**: Launched a high-fidelity, interactive web control center for browsing findings and risk scores directly from the terminal.
    *   **Official GitHub Action**: Introduced the `tharos-action` for one-line integration with GitHub Security, populating the security tab with refined SARIF findings.
    *   **Enterprise SARIF Exporter**: Refined the SARIF engine with rich rule metadata, stable indexing, and precise location mapping for industry-standard compliance.
    *   **Context-Aware Detection**: Improved the "Scanner Mindset" to handle complex variable flows and differentiate between safe boilerplate and true production vulnerabilities.

  <Update label="8th February 2026">
    ### The VS Code & Launch Update

    * **VS Code Extension (v1.0.2)**: Launched the official extension with **Magic Fixes**, zero-config bundled binaries, and precise diagnostic highlighting.
    * **Interactive Remediation**: Extended Magic Fixes to the IDE, allowing one-click security patches alongside the existing CLI interactive mode.
    * **Enterprise Enforcement**: Hardened the exit code logic for CI/CD pipelines, supporting `--strict` mode to fail builds on any security finding.
    * **Multi-Platform Distribution**: Packaged Tharos as a `.vsix` for VS Code and introduced high-fidelity marketing assets for the global launch.
    * **Community & Sponsorship**: Integrated GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective, and Buy Me a Coffee to support the project's long-term growth.
