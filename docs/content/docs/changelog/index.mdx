    This major milestone professionalizes the Tharos ecosystem with automated releases, robust community documentation, and an expanded security engine.

    *   **Release Automation**: Replaced manual tagging with a high-fidelity **GitHub Action** that automatically handles versioning and distribution.
    *   **Community Health Suite**: Established professional **SECURITY.md** and **SUPPORT.md** policies, and updated the contribution guide for modern Go-based development.
    *   **Expanded Security Intelligence**:
        *   **Go**: Added native AST detection for **Insecure CORS** policies.
        *   **Python**: Implemented intelligent **Hardcoded Password** tracking in literal assignments.
        *   **JS/TS**: Added checks for **Insecure Headers** (e.g., detecting disabled security protections) and cross-platform CORS auditing.
    *   **Visual Identity**: Launched the official **Fox Guardian** logo, representing the project's sleek and intelligent protective nature.
    *   **SARIF Compliance**: Fixed critical line-number mapping to ensure 100% compatibility with GitHub's security dashboard.

    ### 🚀 v1.1.0: The Enterprise Polyglot Update
    
    This major release completes the Core Roadmap, transforming Tharos into a high-fidelity, enterprise-ready security suite with deep structural analysis and seamless CI/CD integration.

    *   **Deep Polyglot AST Analysis**: Native, structural security scanning for **Go** and **Python**, detecting complex SQLi, command injection, and insecure deserialization.
    *   **Local Security Dashboard (`tharos ui`)**: Launched a high-fidelity, interactive web control center for browsing findings and risk scores directly from the terminal.
    *   **Official GitHub Action**: Introduced the `tharos-action` for one-line integration with GitHub Security, populating the security tab with refined SARIF findings.
    *   **Enterprise SARIF Exporter**: Refined the SARIF engine with rich rule metadata, stable indexing, and precise location mapping for industry-standard compliance.
    *   **Context-Aware Detection**: Improved the "Scanner Mindset" to handle complex variable flows and differentiate between safe boilerplate and true production vulnerabilities.

    ### The VS Code & Launch Update

    * **VS Code Extension (v1.0.2)**: Launched the official extension with **Magic Fixes**, zero-config bundled binaries, and precise diagnostic highlighting.
    * **Interactive Remediation**: Extended Magic Fixes to the IDE, allowing one-click security patches alongside the existing CLI interactive mode.
    * **Enterprise Enforcement**: Hardened the exit code logic for CI/CD pipelines, supporting `--strict` mode to fail builds on any security finding.
    * **Multi-Platform Distribution**: Packaged Tharos as a `.vsix` for VS Code and introduced high-fidelity marketing assets for the global launch.
    * **Community & Sponsorship**: Integrated GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective, and Buy Me a Coffee to support the project's long-term growth.

  <Update label="6th February 2026">
    ### The Intelligent Gatekeeper Update

    * **Polyglot AST Support**: Expanded semantic analysis to include native **Go** (via `go/ast`) and **Python**, detecting complex SQL injection and command injection patterns.
    * **Policy-as-Code Loader**: Introduced dynamic policy injection from YAML files in the `policies/` directory or via the new `--policy` flag.
    * **Premium CLI Dashboard**: Introduced a high-fidelity terminal UI with structured findings tables and a definitive **COMMIT VERDICT** (Pass/Block) banner.
    * **Data-Driven Security Rules**: You can now define custom regex-based security patterns directly in `tharos.yaml` to catch project-specific vulnerabilities.
    * **Smart Risk Scoring**: Integrated `min_risk_score` configuration to filter AI-generated insights, ensuring you only see the most actionable security intelligence.
    * **Self-Healing Git Hooks**: Launched `tharos sync` and background audit systems that automatically detect and heal tampered or missing git hooks.
