description: How to install and configure Tharos
---

Get up and running with Tharos in minutes.

## Installation

Tharos is distributed as a single binary via NPM. You can install it globally or per-project.

```bash
npm install -g tharos-cli
```

## Initialization

To set up Tharos in your repository, run:

```bash
tharos init
```

This command will:
1.  Initialize a `.tharos` configuration directory.
2.  Install the intelligent git hooks.
3.  Link your repository to your organization's cloud policy (if configured).

## Basic Usage

### Syncing Policies

If your organization uses cloud-managed policies, you can sync them manually:

```bash
tharos sync
```

### Manual Check

You can run a semantic check on your current changes without committing:

```bash
tharos check
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Action

Enforce Tharos policies in your GitHub workflows. Create a file at `.github/workflows/tharos-check.yml`:

```yaml
name: Tharos Policy Check
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm install -g tharos-cli
      - run: tharos check --ci
```

## Configuration

Custom rules and AI settings can be defined in your `.tharos.json` file.

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "provider": "ollama",
    "model": "llama3"
  },
  "policies": [
    "security-hardened",
    "naming-conventions"
  ]
}
```
