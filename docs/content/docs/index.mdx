## Why Tharos?

Traditional git hooks are often bypassed, hard to maintain across teams, and lack deep understanding of the code being committed. Tharos solves these problems by:

1.  **Enforcing Governance**: Policies are synced from the cloud and cannot be easily disabled.
2.  **Providing Context**: AI analysis helps catch security flaws and architectural smells that static analysis misses.
3.  **Ensuring Velocity**: Optimized for speed, Tharos won't slow down your development loop.
